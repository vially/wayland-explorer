The child process\n    should unset the environment variable again right after reading it out in\n    order to avoid propagating it to other child processes.\n\n    Another established way exists for Applications implementing the D-Bus\n    interface org.freedesktop.Application, which should get their token under\n    activation-token on their platform_data.\n\n    In general activation tokens may be transferred across clients through\n    means not described in this protocol.\n\n    The client to be activated will then pass the token\n    it received to the xdg_activation_v1.activate request. The compositor can\n    then use this token to decide how to react to the activation request.\n\n    The token the activating client gets may be ineffective either already at\n    the time it receives it, for example if it was not focused, for focus\n    stealing prevention. The activating client will have no way to discover\n    the validity of the token, and may still forward it to the to be activated\n    client.\n\n    The created activation token may optionally get information attached to it\n    that can be used by the compositor to identify the application that we\n    intend to activate. This can for example be used to display a visual hint\n    about what application is being started.\n\n    Warning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing\n    phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the\n    corresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can\n    only be done by creating a new major version of the extension.","summary":"Protocol for requesting activation of surfaces"},"interfaces":[{"type":"interface","name":"xdg_activation_v1","version":"1","description":{"type":"description","text":"A global interface used for informing the compositor about applications\n      being activated or started, or for applications to request to be\n      activated.","summary":"interface for activating surfaces"},"requests":[{"type":"request","name":"destroy","requestType":"destructor","description":{"type":"description","text":"Notify the compositor that the xdg_activation object will no longer be\n        used.\n\n        The child objects created via this interface are unaffected and should\n        be destroyed separately.","summary":"destroy the xdg_activation object"},"args":[]},{"type":"request","name":"get_activation_token","description":{"type":"description","text":"Creates an xdg_activation_token_v1 object that will provide\n        the initiating client with a unique token for this activation.
