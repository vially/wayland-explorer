        "text": "Following the interfaces from:\nhttps://www.khronos.org/registry/egl/extensions/EXT/EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import.txt\nhttps://www.khronos.org/registry/EGL/extensions/EXT/EGL_EXT_image_dma_buf_import_modifiers.txt\nand the Linux DRM sub-system's AddFb2 ioctl.\n\nThis interface offers ways to create generic dmabuf-based wl_buffers.\n\nClients can use the get_surface_feedback request to get dmabuf feedback\nfor a particular surface. If the client wants to retrieve feedback not\ntied to a surface, they can use the get_default_feedback request.\n\nThe following are required from clients:\n\n- Clients must ensure that either all data in the dma-buf is\ncoherent for all subsequent read access or that coherency is\ncorrectly handled by the underlying kernel-side dma-buf\nimplementation.\n\n- Don't make any more attachments after sending the buffer to the\ncompositor. Making more attachments later increases the risk of\nthe compositor not being able to use (re-import) an existing\ndmabuf-based wl_buffer.\n\nThe underlying graphics stack must ensure the following:\n\n- The dmabuf file descriptors relayed to the server will stay valid\nfor the whole lifetime of the wl_buffer. This means the server may\nat any time use those fds to import the dmabuf into any kernel\nsub-system that might accept it.\n\nHowever, when the underlying graphics stack fails to deliver the\npromise, because of e.g. a device hot-unplug which raises internal\nerrors, after the wl_buffer has been successfully created the\ncompositor must not raise protocol errors to the client when dmabuf\nimport later fails.\n\nTo create a wl_buffer from one or more dmabufs, a client creates a\nzwp_linux_dmabuf_params_v1 object with a zwp_linux_dmabuf_v1.create_params\nrequest. All planes required by the intended format are added with\nthe 'add' request. Finally, a 'create' or 'create_immed' request is\nissued, which has the following outcome depending on the import success.\n\nThe 'create' request,\n- on success, triggers a 'created' event which provides the final\nwl_buffer to the client.\n- on failure, triggers a 'failed' event to convey that the server\ncannot use the dmabufs received from the client.\n\nFor the 'create_immed' request,\n- on success, the server immediately imports the added dmabufs to\ncreate a wl_buffer. No event is sent from the server in this case.\n- on failure, the server can choose to either:\n- terminate the client by raising a fatal error.\n- mark the wl_buffer as failed, and send a 'failed' event to the\nclient. If the client uses a failed wl_buffer as an argument to any\nrequest, the behaviour is compositor implementation-defined.\n\nFor all DRM formats and unless specified in another protocol extension,\npre-multiplied alpha is used for pixel values.\n\nUnless specified otherwise in another protocol extension, implicit\nsynchronization is used. In other words, compositors and clients must\nwait and signal fences implicitly passed via the DMA-BUF's reservation\nmechanism.\n\nDisclaimer: This protocol extension has been marked stable. This copy is\nno longer used and only retained for backwards compatibility. The\ncanonical version can be found in the stable/ directory.",

The Linux kernel's DRM sub-system is the\nauthoritative source on how the format codes should work.\n\nThe 'flags' is a bitfield of the flags defined in enum \"flags\".\n'y_invert' means the that the image needs to be y-flipped.\n\nFlag 'interlaced' means that the frame in the buffer is not\nprogressive as usual, but interlaced.

The temporal\nordering between the two fields is top field first, unless\n'bottom_first' is specified.
