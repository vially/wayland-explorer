        "text": "This protocol is used by Wayland compositors which act as Direct\nRendering Manager (DRM) masters to lease DRM resources to Wayland\nclients.\n\nThe compositor will advertise one wp_drm_lease_device_v1 global for each\nDRM node. Some time after a client binds to the wp_drm_lease_device_v1\nglobal, the compositor will send a drm_fd event followed by zero, one or\nmore connector events. After all currently available connectors have been\nsent, the compositor will send a wp_drm_lease_device_v1.done event.\n\nWhen the list of connectors available for lease changes the compositor\nwill send wp_drm_lease_device_v1.connector events for added connectors and\nwp_drm_lease_connector_v1.withdrawn events for removed connectors,\nfollowed by a wp_drm_lease_device_v1.done event.\n\nThe compositor will indicate when a device is gone by removing the global\nvia a wl_registry.global_remove event. Upon receiving this event, the\nclient should destroy any matching wp_drm_lease_device_v1 object.\n\nTo destroy a wp_drm_lease_device_v1 object, the client must first issue\na release request. Upon receiving this request, the compositor will\nimmediately send a released event and destroy the object. The client must\ncontinue to process and discard drm_fd and connector events until it\nreceives the released event. Upon receiving the released event, the\nclient can safely cleanup any client-side resources.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing\nphase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the\ncorresponding interface version bump. Backward incompatible changes can\nonly be done by creating a new major version of the extension.",
