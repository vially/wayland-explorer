Any complex underlying data structure\na client may use when generating the layout is lost in transmission. This\nis an intentional limitation.\n\nAdditionally, this protocol allows the compositor to deliver arbitrary\nuser-provided commands associated with a layout to clients. A client\nmay use these commands to implement runtime configuration/control, or\nmay ignore them entirely. How the user provides these commands to the\ncompositor is not specified by this protocol and left to compositor policy.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the\ntesting phase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with\nthe corresponding interface version bump.
