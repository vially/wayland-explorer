The\ncompositor can then restrict the features that the sandboxed connections\ncan use.\n\nCompositors should forbid nesting multiple security contexts by not\nexposing wp_security_context_manager_v1 global to clients with a security\ncontext attached, or by sending the nested protocol error. Nested\nsecurity contexts are dangerous because they can potentially allow\nprivilege escalation of a sandboxed client.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is currently in the testing\nphase. Backward compatible changes may be added together with the\ncorresponding interface version bump.
