    "text": "This protocol aims at describing outputs in a way which is more in line\nwith the concept of an output on desktop oriented systems.\n\nSome information are more specific to the concept of an output for\na desktop oriented system and may not make sense in other applications,\nsuch as IVI systems for example.\n\nTypically, the global compositor space on a desktop system is made of\na contiguous or overlapping set of rectangular regions.\n\nThe logical_position and logical_size events defined in this protocol\nmight provide information identical to their counterparts already\navailable from wl_output, in which case the information provided by this\nprotocol should be preferred to their equivalent in wl_output. The goal is\nto move the desktop specific concepts (such as output location within the\nglobal compositor space, etc.) out of the core wl_output protocol.\n\nWarning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and\nbackward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible\nchanges may be added together with the corresponding interface\nversion bump.\nBackward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version\nnumber in the protocol and interface names and resetting the\ninterface version. Once the protocol is to be declared stable,\nthe 'z' prefix and the version number in the protocol and\ninterface names are removed and the interface version number is\nreset.",
