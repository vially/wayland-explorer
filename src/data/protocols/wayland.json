If\nthat's not the case, an invalid_size error is sent.\n\nThe x and y arguments specify the location of the new pending\nbuffer's upper left corner, relative to the current buffer's upper\nleft corner, in surface-local coordinates. In other words, the\nx and y, combined with the new surface size define in which\ndirections the surface's size changes. Setting anything other than 0\nas x and y arguments is discouraged, and should instead be replaced\nwith using the separate wl_surface.offset request.\n\nWhen the bound wl_surface version is 5 or higher, passing any\nnon-zero x or y is a protocol violation, and will result in an\n'invalid_offset' error being raised. The x and y arguments are ignored\nand do not change the pending state. To achieve equivalent semantics,\nuse wl_surface.offset.\n\nSurface contents are double-buffered state, see wl_surface.commit.\n\nThe initial surface contents are void; there is no content.\nwl_surface.attach assigns the given wl_buffer as the pending\nwl_buffer. wl_surface.commit makes the pending wl_buffer the new\nsurface contents, and the size of the surface becomes the size\ncalculated from the wl_buffer, as described above. After commit,\nthere is no pending buffer until the next attach.\n\nCommitting a pending wl_buffer allows the compositor to read the\npixels in the wl_buffer. The compositor may access the pixels at\nany time after the wl_surface.commit request. When the compositor\nwill not access the pixels anymore, it will send the\nwl_buffer.release event. Only after receiving wl_buffer.release,\nthe client may reuse the wl_buffer. A wl_buffer that has been\nattached and then replaced by another attach instead of committed\nwill not receive a release event, and is not used by the\ncompositor.\n\nIf a pending wl_buffer has been committed to more than one wl_surface,\nthe delivery of wl_buffer.release events becomes undefined. A well\nbehaved client should not rely on wl_buffer.release events in this\ncase. Alternatively, a client could create multiple wl_buffer objects\nfrom the same backing storage or use wp_linux_buffer_release.\n\nDestroying the wl_buffer after wl_buffer.release does not change\nthe surface contents. Destroying the wl_buffer before wl_buffer.release\nis allowed as long as the underlying buffer storage isn't re-used (this\ncan happen e.g. on client process termination). However, if the client\ndestroys the wl_buffer before receiving the wl_buffer.release event and\nmutates the underlying buffer storage, the surface contents become\nundefined immediately.\n\nIf wl_surface.attach is sent with a NULL wl_buffer, the\nfollowing wl_surface.commit will remove the surface content.\n\nIf a pending wl_buffer has been destroyed, the result is not specified.\nMany compositors are known to remove the surface content on the following\nwl_surface.commit, but this behaviour is not universal. Clients seeking to\nmaximise compatibility should not destroy pending buffers and should\nensure that they explicitly remove content from surfaces, even after\ndestroying buffers.",

A\nsub-surface's size and position are not limited to that of the parent.\nParticularly, a sub-surface is not automatically clipped to its\nparent's area.\n\nA sub-surface becomes mapped, when a non-NULL wl_buffer is applied\nand the parent surface is mapped. The order of which one happens\nfirst is irrelevant. A sub-surface is hidden if the parent becomes\nhidden, or if a NULL wl_buffer is applied. These rules apply\nrecursively through the tree of surfaces.\n\nThe behaviour of a wl_surface.commit request on a sub-surface\ndepends on the sub-surface's mode. The possible modes are\nsynchronized and desynchronized, see methods\nwl_subsurface.set_sync and wl_subsurface.set_desync. Synchronized\nmode caches the wl_surface state to be applied when the parent's\nstate gets applied, and desynchronized mode applies the pending\nwl_surface state directly. A sub-surface is initially in the\nsynchronized mode.\n\nSub-surfaces also have another kind of state, which is managed by\nwl_subsurface requests, as opposed to wl_surface requests. This\nstate includes the sub-surface position relative to the parent\nsurface (wl_subsurface.set_position), and the stacking order of\nthe parent and its sub-surfaces (wl_subsurface.place_above and\n.place_below). This state is applied when the parent surface's\nwl_surface state is applied, regardless of the sub-surface's mode.\nAs the exception, set_sync and set_desync are effective immediately.\n\nThe main surface can be thought to be always in desynchronized mode,\nsince it does not have a parent in the sub-surfaces sense.\n\nEven if a sub-surface is in desynchronized mode, it will behave as\nin synchronized mode, if its parent surface behaves as in\nsynchronized mode. This rule is applied recursively throughout the\ntree of surfaces. This means, that one can set a sub-surface into\nsynchronized mode, and then assume that all its child and grand-child\nsub-surfaces are synchronized, too, without explicitly setting them.\n\nDestroying a sub-surface takes effect immediately. If you need to\nsynchronize the removal of a sub-surface to the parent surface update,\nunmap the sub-surface first by attaching a NULL wl_buffer, update parent,\nand then destroy the sub-surface.\n\nIf the parent wl_surface object is destroyed, the sub-surface is\nunmapped.\n\nA sub-surface never has the keyboard focus of any seat.\n\nThe wl_surface.offset request is ignored: clients must use set_position\ninstead to move the sub-surface.",
