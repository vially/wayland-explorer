This extension assures the client that the compositor will\n      never attempt to import in to the GPU and pass it directly to the display\n      controller.\n\n      Clients can make use of this extension to pass the dmabuf buffer to the\n      display controller, potentially increasing the performance and lowering the\n      bandwidth usage.\n\n      Lastly, clients can make use of this extension in tandem with content-protection\n      one thus avoiding any GPU interaction and providing a secure-content path.\n      Also, in some cases, the memory where dmabuf are allocated are in specially\n      crafted memory zone which would be seen as an illegal memory access when the\n      GPU will attempt to read it.\n\n      WARNING: This interface by design might break screenshoting functionality\n      as compositing might be involved while doing that.
