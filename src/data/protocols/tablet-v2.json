    "text": "This description provides a high-level overview of the interplay between\nthe interfaces defined this protocol. For details, see the protocol\nspecification.\n\nMore than one tablet may exist, and device-specifics matter. Tablets are\nnot represented by a single virtual device like wl_pointer. A client\nbinds to the tablet manager object which is just a proxy object. From\nthat, the client requests zwp_tablet_manager_v2.get_tablet_seat(wl_seat)\nand that returns the actual interface that has all the tablets. With\nthis indirection, we can avoid merging zwp_tablet_v2 into the actual Wayland\nprotocol, a long-term benefit.\n\nThe zwp_tablet_seat_v2 sends a \"tablet added\" event for each tablet\nconnected. That event is followed by descriptive events about the\nhardware; currently that includes events for name, vid/pid and\na zwp_tablet_v2.path event that describes a local path. This path can be\nused to uniquely identify a tablet or get more information through\nlibwacom. Emulated or nested tablets can skip any of those, e.g. a\nvirtual tablet may not have a vid/pid. The sequence of descriptive\nevents is terminated by a zwp_tablet_v2.done event to signal that a client\nmay now finalize any initialization for that tablet.\n\nEvents from tablets require a tool in proximity. Tools are also managed\nby the tablet seat; a \"tool added\" event is sent whenever a tool is new\nto the compositor. That event is followed by a number of descriptive\nevents about the hardware; currently that includes capabilities,\nhardware id and serial number, and tool type. Similar to the tablet\ninterface, a zwp_tablet_tool_v2.done event is sent to terminate that initial\nsequence.\n\nAny event from a tool happens on the zwp_tablet_tool_v2 interface. When the\ntool gets into proximity of the tablet, a proximity_in event is sent on\nthe zwp_tablet_tool_v2 interface, listing the tablet and the surface. That\nevent is followed by a motion event with the coordinates. After that,\nit's the usual motion, axis, button, etc. events. The protocol's\nserialisation means events are grouped by zwp_tablet_tool_v2.frame events.\n\nTwo special events (that don't exist in X) are down and up. They signal\n\"tip touching the surface\". For tablets without real proximity\ndetection, the sequence is: proximity_in, motion, down, frame.\n\nWhen the tool leaves proximity, a proximity_out event is sent. If any\nbutton is still down, a button release event is sent before this\nproximity event. These button events are sent in the same frame as the\nproximity event to signal to the client that the buttons were held when\nthe tool left proximity.\n\nIf the tool moves out of the surface but stays in proximity (i.e.\nbetween windows), compositor-specific grab policies apply. This usually\nmeans that the proximity-out is delayed until all buttons are released.\n\nMoving a tool physically from one tablet to the other has no real effect\non the protocol, since we already have the tool object from the \"tool\nadded\" event. All the information is already there and the proximity\nevents on both tablets are all a client needs to reconstruct what\nhappened.\n\nSome extra axes are normalized, i.e. the client knows the range as\nspecified in the protocol (e.g. [0, 65535]), the granularity however is\nunknown. The current normalized axes are pressure, distance, and slider.\n\nOther extra axes are in physical units as specified in the protocol.\nThe current extra axes with physical units are tilt, rotation and\nwheel rotation.\n\nSince tablets work independently of the pointer controlled by the mouse,\nthe focus handling is independent too and controlled by proximity.\nThe zwp_tablet_tool_v2.set_cursor request sets a tool-specific cursor.\nThis cursor surface may be the same as the mouse cursor, and it may be\nthe same across tools but it is possible to be more fine-grained. For\nexample, a client may set different cursors for the pen and eraser.\n\nTools are generally independent of tablets and it is\ncompositor-specific policy when a tool can be removed. Common approaches\nwill likely include some form of removing a tool when all tablets the\ntool was used on are removed.",
